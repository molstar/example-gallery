Mol* Example Gallery
====================
This repository serves as a guide to help developers understand and utilize the Mol* code effectively. This gallery aims to provide clear, concise, and practical examples.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Mol* gallery examples, you can try them out in [CodeSandbox](codesandbox.io) or run it locally. 

### CodeSandbox
Simply set the repository path to the example in your CodeSandbox URL and start testing ([example](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/molstar/example-gallery/tree/codesandbox/selection/select_ligand_and_surroundings)). To make your own draft of the example, sign in to CodeSandbox for free.

### Locally

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```
